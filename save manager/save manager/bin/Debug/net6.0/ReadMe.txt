- Navigate to "%localappdata%\Packages\2637SquanchGamesInc.HighonLife_mh7dg3tfmz2cj\SystemAppData\wgs"


- Extract the Savemanager.zip in the wgs folder


- There should be a folder with a name that looks like "000901FB0B4E4F1A_0000000000000000000000006FB5E47F" the first 16 numbers are specific to your computer so the name will be slightly different


- Delete the "000901FB0B4E4F1A_0000000000000000000000006FB5E47F" folder


- Disconnect from you internet (this is to disable cloud saves you only have to disconnect one time)


- Run high on life


- Youll have to finish the buck thunder minigame (Note: Do not load any mods until the setup is complete this includes the "Oregon Trainer" mod having mods installed is fine just dont load them in with the modloader)


- Once you get out of the buck thunder minigame and see lizzie for the first time pause the game, change your sensitivity and press apply changes. You must do this step or the setup wont work.


- You can now reconnect to your internet at any time


- Open the save manager 


- You will be prompted to check the ReadMe press any key to continue


- Select which keybind you would like dodge to be bound to (this is for the superslide glitch)


- Reopen the game 


- Load your save


- Change the keybinds to your liking any binds can be changed except "Slide bash/ Dodge" Once your keybinds are set change your sensitivity again and press apply changes. ( You must set you keybinds now. If you want to do it later you will have to redo the first time setup)


- Close the game


- Press any key in the save manager to continue


- The save manager will close when it is finished with the first time setup
